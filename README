EliteGL - An OpenGL Port of Christian Pinder's "Elite: The New Kind"
By Mark Follett <mef123@geocities.com>
Version 1.0.0

This port requires you to have the SDL and SDL_mixer libraries installed.
For optional Mp3 support (C-64 music), you need SMPEG.

SDL, SDL_mixer, and SMPEG can all be downloaded from www.libsdl.org.

To build,  run
	./configure
	make

Then copy the compiled elitegl binary from ./src to the elitegl data directory
to run it.
